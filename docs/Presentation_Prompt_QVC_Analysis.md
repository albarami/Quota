### SLIDE 3: Methodology Overview
**Title:** How We Analyzed the Data

**Data Sources:**
- Visa Permit (VP) allocation records from QVC offices
- Establishment-level permit data
- Profession classification codes
- Historical allocation trends

**Analysis Framework:**
1. Data Collection → Aggregated VP allocations by nationality, profession, and establishment
2. Tier Classification → Categorized professions based on concentration share
3. Utilization Assessment → Calculated used vs. allocated permits
4. Risk Identification → Flagged dominance concentrations exceeding thresholds
5. Recommendations → Generated cap suggestions based on utilization and growth

### SLIDE 4: Tier Classification Methodology
**Title:** How Tiers Are Calculated

**Formula:** `Tier = (Profession VP / Total Nationality VP) × 100%`

| Tier | Name | Share Range | Risk Level | Description |
|------|------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| **Tier 1** | Primary | > 15% | High | Dominant professions requiring active monitoring |
| **Tier 2** | Secondary | 5% - 15% | Moderate | Significant professions with notable presence |
| **Tier 3** | Minor | 1% - 5% | Low | Regular professions with limited concentration |
| **Tier 4** | Unusual | < 1% | Minimal | Specialized/niche professions |

**Dominance Alert Thresholds:**
- WATCH: 30% - 39% (Monitor trends)
- HIGH: 40% - 49% (Active intervention needed)
- CRITICAL: 50%+ (Block new approvals)

---

### SLIDE 5: Cap Recommendation Methodology
**Title:** How We Calculate Recommended Caps

**Three Recommendation Models:**

| Model | Description | Formula |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Conservative** | Minimal growth, risk-averse | Current Stock × 1.05 |
| **Moderate** | Balanced growth | Current Stock × 1.10 + Headroom Adjustment |
| **Flexible** | Growth-oriented | Current Stock × 1.15 + Market Demand Factor |

**Factors Considered:**
1. Current utilization rate
2. Historical growth trends
3. Tier concentration risk
4. Dominance alert status
5. Economic sector demand

| Category | QVC Countries | Additional Countries | Total |
|----------|---------------|---------------------|-------|
| Total Allocation/Stock | 513,236 | 112,193 | 625,429 |

### SLIDE 3: Methodology Overview
**Title:** How We Analyzed the Data

**Data Sources:**
- **QVC Countries:** VP allocation records from Qatar Visa Centers
- **Additional Countries:** Ministry worker stock database

**Analysis Framework:**
1. **Data Collection** → Aggregated by nationality, profession, establishment
2. **Tier Classification** → Categorized based on concentration share
3. **Utilization Assessment** → Used vs. allocated (QVC) / Active vs. cap (Others)
4. **Risk Identification** → Flagged dominance exceeding thresholds
5. **Recommendations** → Cap suggestions based on utilization and risk

---

### SLIDE 4: Tier Classification Methodology
**Title:** How Tiers Are Calculated

**Formula:** `Share = (Profession Workers / Total Nationality Workers) × 100%`

| Tier | Name | Share Range | Risk Level | Description |
|------|------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| **Tier 1** | Primary | > 15% | High | Dominant professions - active monitoring |
| **Tier 2** | Secondary | 5% - 15% | Moderate | Significant presence |
| **Tier 3** | Minor | 1% - 5% | Low | Limited concentration |
| **Tier 4** | Unusual | < 1% | Minimal | Niche professions |

**Dominance Alert Thresholds:**
- WATCH: 30% - 39% (Monitor trends)
- HIGH: 40% - 49% (Intervention needed)
- CRITICAL: 50%+ (Block approvals)

---

### SLIDE 5: Cap Recommendation Methodology
**Title:** How We Calculate Recommended Caps

**Three Recommendation Models:**

| Model | Description | Formula |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Conservative** | Risk-averse | Current Stock × 1.05 |
| **Moderate** | Balanced | Current Stock × 1.10 |
| **Flexible** | Growth-oriented | Current Stock × 1.15 |

**Adjustment Factors:**
- High utilization (>80%) → Allow growth
- Low utilization (<50%) → Reduce allocation
- Dominance alert → Cap growth, require diversification
- Negative growth trend → Maintain current cap
